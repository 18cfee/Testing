(listening) really wants to understand what the other person is thinking or their reasoning

people understand their decisions and will take responsibilty, but are willing to change their mind and energetically accept things that are not quite what they are aiming for, not too rigid or narrowminded in their thinking. not controlling 

humble to see mistakes and improve, example would be laughing at themselves

They have the grit to figure out hard problems and work hard

Smart with strong technical experienc

Really willing to dig into feedback both in giving and receiving, chill but say meaningfulSTuff when necessary
